React practice project. "Second" part with url modifying implementation.

Moding via url usage:

    appending /polute|5 to url will lead to creating 5 red houses with 1 floor and random id

    appending /add|#ffff|3 to url will lead to creating a house with color #ffff, 3 floors and random id

    appending /color|f23a|#00000 to url will lead to changing color value to #00000 for the house with id f23a

    appending /floors|b23a|3 to url will lead to changing floors value to 3 for the house with id b23a
